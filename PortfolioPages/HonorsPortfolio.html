                <p> I participated in HPU's Honors Summer Study Abroad Program when I was a rising junior. 
                    We were living in Prague, and I also visited other locations such 
                    as Brno, Český Krumlov, and Dresden, Germany.  

                    <br><br>
                    I really enjoyed immersing myselif in other cultures and creating new memories.
                    The course emphasized the importance of spaces and places in shaping our lives and 
                    how they influence our memories.
                    I intend to return to Prague during another trip in the future.

                    <br><br> Our research topic focused on work culture. Specficially, how the rise in instant 
                    communication technologies has affected work-life balance in the workforce. We collected data through
                    surveys and interviews and found interesting results between different age groups and work fields.

                <p> This project-based course explored network science, focusing on methods for collecting,
                     representing, and analyzing network data using graphs and matrices. We applied graph 
                     theory, which is the study of graphs formed by collections of vertices and edges between them,
                    to develop solutions to real-world problems.

                       I based my final project off of NCAA Basketball recruits in relation to team ranking and
                        March Madness tournament results. I created yearly graphs from 2006-2021.

                <p> This class examined how biological processes from the womb shape unique adult characteristics,
                     using genetics, cell biology, and embryology as a foundation. We also explored how these developmental
                     factors influence adult life. It incorporated insights from 
                     psychology, sociology, anthropology, history, ethics, and global studies.

                    We combined discussions with lab experiments on zebrafish, studying the effects of pesticides. 
                    My group focused on how stress response behaviors differed in zebrafish exposed to varying levels of herbicide from birth.

                <p>  
                    This honors course introduced us to literature and the arts produced by participants and observers of the war in Spain.
                    We reviewed films, poems, photographs, novels, paintings, memoirs, and propaganda posters. 
                    <br><br>
                    Throughout the semester, we questioned how a conflict is remembered through the various narratives 
                    that are told about it. 
                    I really enjoyed the content of this course and it was taught by one of my favorite professors.

                <p> I joined the Research Rookies program to improve my research skills while I was studying Physics. 
                    Although I changed my majors, completing this year-long research program taught me a lot about 
                    conducting ethical and useful research.   
                    It became a great stepping stone that prepared me for my future research endeavors.

            <p> The Dean's List is rewarded to any student that achieves a GPA of 3.5 or higher in an academic semester. 
                It symbolizes hard work and academic excellence.

                I have been a Dean's List recipient each semester throughout my four years as an undergraduate student.
